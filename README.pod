=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 codepoint_to_bytes

Takes a Unicode codepoint number and returns a scalar of UTF-8 encoded bytes
for it. Exported on request.

=head2 bytes_to_codepoint

Takes UTF-8 encoded bytes in a scalar and returns the Unicode codepoint for it.

This is a naive encoder - it doesn't handle UTF-16 pairs, BOM or other
noncharacters like 0xFFFE. It's also very slow!
